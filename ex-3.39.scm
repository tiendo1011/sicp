; original five possibilities

; 101: P1 sets x to 100 and then P2 increments x to 101.
; 121: P2 increments x to 11 and then P1 sets x to x * x .
; 110: P2 changes x from 10 to 11 between the two times that
;      P1 accesses the value of x during the evaluation of (* x x) .
; 11: P2 accesses x , then P1 sets x to 100, then P2 sets x .
; 100: P1 accesses x (twice), then P2 sets x to 11, then P1 sets x .

; It's possible for 101, 121, 100
