Exercise in the book "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, 2nd ed"

Initially I used repl.it, nice experience at the beginning,
but as I move along with the book, repl.it's interpreter lacks some procedure mentioned in the
book ((runtime), for eg). So I moved to run the code on my local machine.

Setup follow the instruction here:

Only one difference, I use this version of tslime instead of the one
mentioned in the post: https://github.com/jgdavey/tslime.vim
